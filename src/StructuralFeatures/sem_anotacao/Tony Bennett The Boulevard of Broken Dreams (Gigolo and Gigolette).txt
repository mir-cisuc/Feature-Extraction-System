I walk along the street of sorrow -
The boulevard of broken dreams -
Where Gigolo and Gigolette -
Can take a kiss without regret -
And so forget their broken dreams

You laugh today and cry tomorrow -
When you behold your shattered schemes -
And Gigolo and Gigolette wake up to find
Their eyes are wet with tears that tell of
Broken dreams

"Here is where you'll always find me -
Always walking up and down -
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town"

The joy that you find here, you borrow -
You cannot keep it long it seems -
But Gigolo and Gigolette -
Still sing a song and dance along -
The boulevard of broken dreams

"Here is where you'll always find me -
Always walking up and down -
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town"

The joy that you find here, you borrow -
You cannot keep it long it seems -
But Gigolo and Gigolette -
Still sing a song and dance along -
The boulevard of broken dreams

[Verse 1]
Said the night wind to the little lamb
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancin' in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite"

[Verse 2]
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringin' through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song, high above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea"

[Verse 3]
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
"Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold"

[Verse 4]
Said the king to the people everywhere
"Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A Child, a Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light"

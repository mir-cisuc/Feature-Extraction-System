[Verse 1]
I'll probably never see you eye to eye again
This letter is meant to be my last farewell
But you need to understand I'm nearly crazy
You need to know my life has gone to hell
Write me back and tell me why it ended
Send a letter that I can show my heart
I'll be somewhere between 'I love you'
And what you're feeling now
Looking for a place to fall apart

[Chorus]
Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hiding when I feel the teardrops start
Looking for a place to fall apart

[Verse 2]
I can't seem to justify your leaving me
I'm bewildered as to how it all came down
I thought everything was fine until your phone call
The call that turned my world around
Send me word and tell me why it ended
I need some final proof to show my heart
I'll be somewhere between 'I love you'
And what you're feeling now
Looking for a place to fall apart

[Chorus]
Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hiding when I feel the teardrops start
Looking for a place to fall apart
Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hiding when I feel the teardrops start
Looking for a place to fall apart

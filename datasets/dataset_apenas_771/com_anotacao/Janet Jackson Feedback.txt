[Intro]
Light skin, dark skin, my asian persuasion
I got them all, that's why these girls out here hatin'
'Cause I'm sexy
Do you like my style?
Yeah, that sexy, sexy, sexy
Like how I get down
Yeah, that sexy, sexy, sexy
You can work me out
Yeah, that sexy, sexy, sexy
Let me show you how
Yeah, that sexy, sexy, sexy

[Verse 1]
So here's my demonstration - a peep show
Tonight my body's an exhibition, baby
Though it's on display, don't be scared to
Touch it, it's hands on
So come and get it, babe

[Chorus]
Strum me like a guitar, blow out my amplifier
When you hear some feedback, keep going take it higher
Crank it up, give it to me, come on
Crank it up, give it to me, come on
I'm gonna feedback, feedback, oh
Feedback, feedback, oh
Crank it up, give it to me, come on
Crank it up, give it to me, come on
I'm gonna feedback, feedback, oh
Feedback, feedback, oh

[Bridge]
You like it how I work my spine
Got you feeling all hypnotized
I gotta body like a CL5
Make a nigga wanna test drive, but I'm so on fire
Flyer than a pelican, find another chick better than

'Cause my swag is serious
Something heavy like a first day period

[Chorus]
Strum me like a guitar, blow out my amplifier
When you hear some feedback, keep going take it higher
Crank it up, give it to me, come on
Crank it up, give it to me, come on

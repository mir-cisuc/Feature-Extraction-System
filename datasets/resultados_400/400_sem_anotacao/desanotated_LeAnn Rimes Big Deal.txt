Well, he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy to ever let him get away
But, girl
You should know better
Then to go bragging in my face
So forgive me
For what I'm 'bout to say

Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal

He's perfect
I heard ya
The first ten times that you told me
(Yeah, yeah)
It's amazing
His loving
I can't believe I let him go
I regret it
There I said it
You call yourself a friend
But you just keep rubbing it in

Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was
I swear if I hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal

Congratulations
I'm just so happy for you
I can't contain the way I feel
Big deal

Big deal
So what
Who cares
You just got lucky
That's all it was
Shut up
Don't wanna hear another word about
Candlelight and long stem roses
And how you're falling head over heels
In love
So what
Big deal
In love
So what
Big deal
Big deal
Oh, yeah!
Big deal

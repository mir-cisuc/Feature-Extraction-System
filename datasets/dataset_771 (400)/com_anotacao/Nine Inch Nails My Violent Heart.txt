[Verse 1]
You and I, we may look the same
But we are very far apart
There's bullet holes where my compassion used to be
And there is violence in my heart
Into fire you can send us
From the fire we return
You can label us a consequence
Of how much you have to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
You can try but you'll never understand
This is something you will never understand
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now?
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus 1]
On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our bones
Our skin
We will not let you in

[Verse 2]
You have set something in motion
Much greater than you've ever known
Standing there in all your grand naivety
About to reap what you have sown
Time will feed upon your weaknesses
And soon you'll lose the will to care
When you return to the place that you call home
We will be there
We will be there

[Chorus 2]
On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood
Will stay
We will not go away
On hands and knees
We crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood
Our grace
Will never leave this place

[Outro]
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
